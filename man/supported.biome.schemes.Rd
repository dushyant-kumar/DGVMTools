\description{
The biomes schemes that are currently supported for LPJ-GUESS output.  
It a list of biomes schemes with elements with the followinf names/ids:

\describe{
\item{Smith2014}{Classification of global output as per Smith et al. 2014. 
 Designed to be compared to Haxeltine and Prentice (1996) map of potential natural biomes.}
 \item{Forrest2015}{Classification of of global output into coarser mega biomes as per Forrest et al. 2015 (see appendix), 
 which is really just an aggregation of biomes following Harrison and Prentice 2006.  Can be compared to aggregated Haxeltine and Prentice (1996) map.}
 \item{Hickler2012}{Classification of european output as per Hickler et al. 2012.}
 \item{Megabiomes_dev}{Unpublished for potentially useful classification of global biomes 
 which is slightly simpler than Smith et al. 2014.}
 \item{FPCMegabiomes}{Global biomes classification based on FPC.  Ask Joerg Steinkamp 
 about this one.} 
}

The mechanics of all this could do with a serious overhaul to deal with other model outputs
and classifications involving more that one 'primary variable', ie FPC and biomass.
