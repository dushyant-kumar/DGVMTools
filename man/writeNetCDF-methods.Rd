\arguments{
\item{x}{A Field or Raster* object to be written as a netCDF file.  The method can also handle a list of arrays (each array in the list represents one layer)
but this is more of a technical, internal use of this method.}

\item{filename}{A character specifying the name of the netCDF file to be written.}

\item{start.date}{A data (as a POSIX data) for the start of the time dimension.  Can be omitted for a Field (), \emph{must} be included if you want to write 
a RasterStack or RasterBrick with a time dimension.}

\item{monthly}{Logical specifying if the data has has a monthly time resolution. Is ignored for a Field, but it is necessary to set it to TRUE if you want to make a netCDF file out
of a RasterStack or RasterBrick where each layer represents a month.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if TRUE print a bunch of progress and debug output}

\item{quantity}{A DGVMTools::Quantity object.  This is to provide meta-data (units, names) if saving a Raster* object, it is ignored in the case of a Field (but not
if you want to use different meta-data for a Field just alter the Quantity object in the Field object before you call writeNetCDF)}

\item{source}{A DGVMTools::Source object.  This is to provide meta-data about teh source of the data (model run/dataset, climate forcing, cintact person etc)
if saving a Raster* object. It is ignored in the case of a Field (but not if you want to use different meta-data for a Field just alter the Source object in the Field object before you call writeNetCDF)}

\item{layer.dim.name}{A character string specifing the name of the fourth 'layers' dimension (ie not lon, lat or time).  If not specified (or NULL) then no fourth dimension
is created and each layer gets its own variable in the netCDF.  If it is specified, the layers are 'collapsed' on to elements on this fourth, layers, dimension.}

\item{lat.dim.name}{Character, the latitude dimension name. Defaults to "Lat".}

\item{lon.dim.name}{Character, the longitude dimension name. Defaults to "Lon".}

\item{time.dim.name}{Character, the time dimension name. Defaults to "Time".}

\item{precision}{Character, the output precision (alternatively type, confusingly) to use in the netCDF file (see the 'prec' argument of ncdf4::ncvar_def, can be  'short', 'integer', 'float', 'double', 'char', 'byte').  Default is 'float'.}

\item{time.values}{The time dimension information (in the case of Raster*, is ignored for a Field).  Format is 'days since' the 'start.date' argument.  NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENT, CAN MAYBE REPLACE 'monthly'?}

\item{...}{Other arguments, not currently used



These methods offers two very convienent things.  Firsly, it allows the exporting of a DGVMTools::Field object as a standard netCDF file.  Secondly, it provides a more
convenient way to write Raster* objects as netCDF objects than writeRaster (at least in the eye's of the author).  This because is allows specifying of meta data and a time axis, 
allows some flexibility in the formatting, should write CF-standard compliant files and doesn't invert the latitudes.}
